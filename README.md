# FestivalInstrumentMapper

Maps a variety of Guitar Hero and Rock Band instruments as Xbox One guitars, for usage in Fortnite Festival's new plastic/"pro" modes.

In theory, it supports Santroller, Xbox 360, PS3, Wii Rock Band, and Raphnet guitars and adapters.

## Building

**This is only for advanced users and developers who want to work on the tool! If you just want to use it,
download the latest release from the releases page.**

To compile this yourself, you need Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ and C# development tools installed, as well
as the .NET 8 SDK.

Compiling the main mapper utility can be done by opening the .sln and building it normally.

For the compiled ou'll need to compile the following 2 DLLs and put them next to the resulting EXE file:

* [PlasticBandToGip](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/PlasticBandToGip) - native components for translating controllers
* [GipSyntheticEx](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/GipSyntheticEx) - extensions to the Xbox GIP Synthetic library.
